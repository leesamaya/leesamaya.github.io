    <ol>
        <li><strong>Find your victim</strong><br>
        I mean the luckiest boy alive. Found him? Ok, good. Next:</li>

        <li><strong>Look at them</strong><br>
        Where is he? Oh! There he is! Ah, he’s so very pretty. Politely notice this for as long as your heart desires.</li>

        <li><strong>FUCK! He caught me staring!</strong><br>
        Listen carefully, because this step is vital. You must fight every single atom in your body begging you to look away. 
            Hold it, I dare you, and I promise there will be a chance that you won't need Ecstasy pills one day because why would you, when 
            you can always access the 2.5 second memory of tentative staring that is now boiled into your cranium? Now, for those who demand 
            figures: there is a 7% (do you want ecstacy or not?) chance his tummy will do a flip and 50% of that 7% will hold your gaze 
            (% may vary depending on confidence levels at given moment). The other 93% are those of who are part of the wider general population who do not like you like that, and never will. 
            We do not sweat this. It is not personal. Sometimes,
        this cohort may find themselves in the 7% cohort in the beginning, and then realise they are part of the 93%. We also do not sweat this. It is not personal.</li>

        <li><strong>Disappear mysteriously</strong><br>
        This may be a hard pill to swallow, but sometimes you are better off as a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144519302487" target="_blank">concept</a>.</li>

        <li><strong>Just kidding.</strong><br>
        Walk up to him and say this (word for word):<br>
        <blockquote>Hello. My name is ________ (*your name*). I’m going to skip rocks by the river tonight. Do you want to come?</blockquote>
        Now. If he didn't look away at Step #3, there is a 91% chance he will say yes. The boy may look puzzled at first, and this is normal. 
            You will witness the internal battle flash across his face, one between his heart and his brain. It'll go something like this:<br>
        <em>*I don’t think this is a good idea - But Brain, she’s so cute and funny and smart and sexy, how could I miss this? - She could murder you - And?*</em><br>
        
            And so on. 
        <p>Congratulations, you've done your job. The rest is up to the boy's organs. I implore you to distance yourself from the outcome and 
            feel proud of yourself for interacting with the world as if it were bendable (it is). You know you're going 
            to have fun skipping rocks by the river anyway. That plan doesn't go away.
            The Romantic era never really ended; the romantic spirit of the late 18th century is still alive and well in our collective psyche of the Western world. 
            Perhaps it left us with a hunger reality can rarely satisfy, a longing that has us in denial that money isn't real, when it is, and very.
            But maybe it's not so bad. Without restless denial of the Real World, we wouldn't bother to try bend it a little. We wouldn't try making beautiful things, or say yes to strange girls 
            asking us to skip rocks with them by the river.
