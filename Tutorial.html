    <ol>
        <li><strong>Find your victim</strong><br>
        I mean the luckiest boy alive. Found him? Ok, good. Next:</li>

        <li><strong>Look at them</strong><br>
        Where did he go? Oh, there he is! Ah, he’s quite pretty. Politely notice this for as long as your heart desires.</li>

        <li><strong>FUCK! He caught me staring!</strong><br>
        Listen carefully, because this step is critical: resist every atom in your body that begs you to look away. 
            Because if you can hold it - and I mean really hold it - then someday, when you are older and wiser, you won't need Ecstasy pills. Why would you, when 
            you can access the 2.5 second memory of tentative, reciprocal staring that is now boiled into your cranium? Now, for the skeptics who demand 
            figures: there is a 7% (do you want ecstacy or not?) chance he'll feel his tummy drop like yours. And, maybe, 15% of that 7% (% may fluctuate depending 
            on confidence levels at given moment) will look right back, 
            and recognise you. You know what I mean.
            Of course, that leaves a daunting 98.95%: the wider, indifferent 
            majority who do not see you this way, and never will. 
            We do not sweat this. It is not personal. Sometimes,
        those wandering souls slip into the 1.05%, toy with the idea of seeing you truly, then quietly return to the 98.95%. This, too, we do not sweat. It is not personal.</li>

        <li><strong>Disappear mysteriously</strong><br>
        This may be a hard pill to swallow, but sometimes you are better off as a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144519302487" target="_blank">concept</a>.</li>

        <li><strong>Just kidding.</strong><br>
        Walk up to him and say this (word for word):<br>
        <blockquote>Hello. My name is ________ (*your name*). I’m going to skip rocks by the river tonight. Do you want to come?</blockquote>
        If he didn't look away at Step #3, there's a 91% chance he'll say yes. The boy may look puzzled at first; this is normal. 
            You'll watch the split-second battle between his heart and his brain that goes something like this:<br>
        <em>*I don’t think this is a good idea- But Brain, she’s so cute and funny and smart and sexy, how can I say no?- She could murder you-! -And?*</em><br>
        
        <p>And so on. </p> 
        
        </p>Congratulations, you've done your job. The rest is up to the boy's organs. I implore you to distance yourself from the outcome and 
        feel proud of yourself for interacting with the world as if it were bendable (because it is). Whatever happens, you know you're going 
        to have fun skipping rocks by the river anyway.<p>
