    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="intro">
       We are always wanting, aren’t we? Want pulls us out of sleep. I tell myself I am a conqueror, that the world is mine to take. I am, after all, Young! Hungry! With so much ahead of me it drives me mad.

Once, I told a boy I was hungry. Not for food. He worked at a startup I wanted to be at. He was flicking his pencil, the tip brushing my elbow. Tap. Tap. Tap. Not accidental, no. No? I don’t know. Tap. Tap. Tap. Did he know he was doing it? Did he mean to?

He kept talking. Polite, his tone easy. But in his eyes, something else. A private joke, a small flicker of something withheld, something private. The pencil kept tapping, a rhythm I couldn’t decode, unbalancing me.

It was a secret language, yes. Or perhaps an equation. One tap = *hello, are you there?* Steady like a metronome and impossibly deliberate. A question? An invitation? I didn’t know. We stood side by side. I couldn’t see his face — only the words we exchanged, so normal, so surface level, while I tried to make sense of the tapping. I wondered if I were imagining it. Or, in his quiet way, if he were signalling something I couldn’t yet translate.

And suddenly, he was no longer just a boy anymore. He became a version of me I hadn’t arrived at — someone with a plan, someone who knew what to do with themselves.

I stood there, trying to hold his gaze when he looked my way, trying to meet whatever it was he might have seen in me. Who was I? The person he thought I was? Or the one I feared I might be? Or something else entirely — something neither complete nor doomed. A *not yet*?

Because, the truth is, I wasn’t who I claimed to be. I’m no conqueror. I like my coffee iced and sweet. I watch movies where nothing much happens. I waste my hours and stand still under trees, staring at their shapes as though I’d never seen one before.

I wonder if that’s laziness. Or ambition, so large, that I cannot bear being a *not yet.* Or maybe that’s just the excuse I use to feel better about myself.

That night, I left him there - the boy, the tapping, the look in his eyes. I walked away, but the wanting followed. It always does.
