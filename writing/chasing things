    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="intro">
     We are always wanting, aren’t we? Want pulls us out of sleep. I tell myself I am a conqueror, that the world is mine to take. I am, after all, <i>Young! Hungry!</i> 
With so much ahead of me it drives me mad.<p>

Once, I told a boy I was hungry. Not for food. He worked at a startup I wanted to be at. He flicked his pencil with his index finger and thumb, 
the tip stopping at my elbow. Tap. Tap. Tap. Not accidental. No? I don’t know. Tap. Tap. Tap. Did he know he was doing it? Did he mean to? 
He kept talking, tone easy, polite. But in his eyes, something else: a private joke, a small flicker of something withheld, something private. 
The tapping continues.<p>

It was a secret language, I thought. Or an equation. One tap = *hello, are you there?* Steady like a metronome and impossibly deliberate. 
We stood side by side. I couldn’t see his face — only the normality of our conversation, while I tried to make sense of the tapping. 
I wondered if I imagined it. Or if, in his quiet way, he was signaling something I couldn’t yet decode.<p>

Suddenly, he was no longer just a boy anymore. He became a version of me I hadn’t yet reached — someone with a plan, someone who knew what to do with themselves.

I stood there, trying to meet his gaze when he looked my way, trying to be whatever he might have seen in me. Which was real? The person he thought I was? Or the one 
I feared I might be? Or maybe something else — a <i>not yet.</i>Neither doomed nor formed.<p>

Because, truthfully, I wasn’t who I said I was. No conqueror. I like my coffee iced and sweet. I watch movies where nothing much happens. I waste my hours standing 
under trees, staring at them like I’ve never seen one before. Maybe that’s laziness. Or ambition too large to bear the weight of a <i>not yet.</i>Or maybe it’s just the excuse I tell myself.<p>

That night, I left him there - the boy, the tapping, the look in his eyes. I walked away, but the wanting followed. It always does.
