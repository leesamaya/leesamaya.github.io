    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="intro">
     We are always wanting, aren’t we? Want pulls us out of sleep. I tell myself I am a conqueror, that the world is mine to take. After all, I am <i>Young! Hungry!</i> 
With so much ahead of me it drives me mad.<p>

Once, I told a boy I was hungry. Not for food. He worked at a startup I wanted to be at. He flicked his pencil with his index and his thumb, tip stopping at my elbow. 
Tap. Tap. Tap. Not accidental, no. No? I don’t know. Tap. Tap. Tap. Did he know he was doing it? Did he mean to? 
He kept talking; polite, tone easy. But in his eyes, something else: a private joke, a small flicker of something withheld.<p>

A secret language, yes. Or, perhaps an equation: one tap = <i>hello, are you there?</i> Steady like a metronome and, ah, impossibly deliberate. 
We stood side by side. I couldn’t see his face — only the words exchanged, so ordinary. 
Did I imagine it? Or, in his quiet way, was he was coding a signal I couldn’t yet translate?<p>

And then he wasn’t just a boy anymore. He was me in another world, if I had known what to do with myself. I stood there, met his gaze when he looked my way, 
and tried on whoever he thought I was. And then the question comes: What is real? The person he saw? Or the one I feared I might be? Or maybe something 
else — and this is more hopeful - a <i>not yet.</i> Neither doomed nor formed.<p>

Because, truthfully, I wasn’t who I said I was. No conqueror. I like my coffee iced and sweet. I watch movies where nothing much happens. I waste my hours standing 
under trees, staring at them like I’ve never seen one before. Maybe that’s laziness. Or ambition too large to bear the weight of a <i>not yet.</i> Or maybe it’s just the excuse I tell myself.<p>

I had left him there that night - the boy, the tapping, the look in his eyes. I walked away, but the wanting followed. It always does. </div>
