    <!-- Title -->
    <div class="title">Chasing Things</div>
We are always wanting. Wanting is what moves us, what keeps us out of bed. Without it, we are just weight.

Once, I told a boy I was hungry. Not for food. He worked at a startup I wanted to work at. He tapped his pencil on my elbow, tap, tap tap. Too casually to be deliberate, but too steady to be accidental. Tap, tap, tap. Did he know? I wondered if he knew. 

He kept talking. Friendly, polite, all the right words. But his eyes lingered. The pencil tapped. His eyes held mine. The tapping matched my heartbeat, and I didn’t know if I wanted it to stop.

And suddenly he wasn’t just a boy anymore. He was sharp edges and certainty, the things I pretended to have. Ambition without hesitation, competence that wasn’t a question. He had a plan, and he believed in it. I watched him and thought, this is what it looks like to know what you’re doing. 

I stood there, trying to match his gaze, trying to be what he might have seen in me. And for a moment, it felt real. Like maybe I could be that too. Solid.

But I am not solid. I like my coffee iced and sweet and get lost in movies where nothing happens. I sleep deeply and waste my time. Take me on a walk and I’ll be amused.

I want so many things it hurts. And when it hurts too much, I stop. I lay down in the grass or stare at the ceiling. I wonder if I am lazy. Or if I am so afraid of failing that I can’t bring myself to start.

That day, I walked away from the boy, from the pencil tapping against my skin, from the way his eyes lingered. But the wanting followed. It always does.
