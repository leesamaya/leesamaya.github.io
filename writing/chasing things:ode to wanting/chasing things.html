   <!-- Introduction -->
<div class="intro">
    <p>We are always wanting, aren’t we? Want drags us from sleep, it makes us walk faster and think sharper. I tell myself I am capable, that what I seek is within reach. I am young, hungry, destined to conquer. There is much to grab, much to chase. It leaves me dizzy.</p>

    <p>Once, I told a boy I was hungry. Not for food. He worked at a startup I wanted. He flicked a pencil with his thumb and index finger, the tip hitting my elbow - tap, tap, tap. Not accidental. Or was it? His voice was polite, his tone light. His eyes, something else.</p>

    <p>A code, I thought.</p>
    <p>1 tap = <i>are you there?</i></p>
    <p>2 taps = <i>can you see me?</i></p>
    <p>The rest, I couldn't decipher.</p>

    <p>We stood side by side, not looking at each other. I could only see our words, so ordinary, just like anyone's. Had I imagined it? Yet he was no longer a boy. He became something else.</p>

    <p>A mirror. An alternate self: someone who knew how to speak and where to stand, what to do with her hands. I met his gaze and tested this version of me, the one he seemed to see. Not bad, I thought.</p>

    <p>And then, the question: Which self was real? The one he saw, or the one I knew? Or, let me say it another way: was my fate doomed, or not doomed? One world allowed me to want.</p>

    <p>Now I understand, or think I do. The in-between is not failure. The quiet relief of it: permission to exist in the not yet. To stand here, unformed, without proof or certainty, is not to fail. It is to begin.</p>

    <p>Because, truthfully, I wasn’t who I said I was. No conqueror. I drink my coffee iced and sweet. I like movies where nothing much happens. I waste hours staring at trees like they’ve just appeared, their green overwhelming. I’m impatient, indecisive, never waiting for the kettle to boil. Laziness, perhaps. Or want, panicked and directionless, burning inward.</p>

    <p>That night, I left him. Left the taps, the gaze, the unspoken. I walked away. The wanting stayed. It always does.</p>
