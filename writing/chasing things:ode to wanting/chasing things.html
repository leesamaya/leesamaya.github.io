   <!-- Introduction -->
<div class="intro">
    <p>We are always wanting, aren’t we? Want drags us from sleep, it makes us walk faster and think sharper. I tell myself I am a <i>conqueror</i>, that the world is mine to take, and the words swell in my chest like helium. I am <i>Young. Hungry.</i> I've got so much going for me, like come on, it drives me crazy.</p>

    <p>Once, I told a boy I was hungry. Not for food. He worked at some startup I wanted to be at. He flicked a pencil with his thumb and index finger. The tip hit my elbow - tap, tap, tap. Not accidental. Or maybe not? I couldn’t tell. He talked polite, tone easy. His eyes: something else.</p>

    <p>A secret language, I decided. Or maybe an equation:</p>
    <p>1 tap = <i>hello, are you there?</i></p>
    <p>2 taps = <i>can you see me?</i></p>
    <p>But I didn’t know the rest of the code.</p>

    <p>We stood side by side, not looking at each other. I could only see our words, so ordinary. Had I imagined it?</p>

    <p>He was no longer a boy anymore. He was something else. An alternate version of myself, maybe, from a life where I knew what to say and how to stand, where to put my hands. I met his gaze like a dare and tried on the version of me he seemed to see. <i>Huh. Not bad.</i></p>

    <p>Then, the question: Which one was real? The me he saw, or the me I saw? Or, let me translate: was my fate doomed, or not doomed? One world let me want.</p>

    <p>But now I get it. (I say this reluctantly.) The in-between is enough. The relief of it: to exist in the not yet.</p>

    <p>Because, truthfully, I wasn’t who I said I was. No conqueror. I drink my coffee iced and sweet. I like movies where nothing much happens. I waste hours staring at trees like they’ve just appeared, their green overwhelming. I’m impatient, indecisive, and I never wait for the kettle to boil. Is that laziness? Or is it want burnt inwards, when the <i>yet</i> fades in and out after the <i>not</i>? Maybe it’s just the excuse I tell myself.</p>

    <p>I had left that night. The boy, the tapping, the look in his eyes. I walked away, but the wanting stayed. It always does.</p>
