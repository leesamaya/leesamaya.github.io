    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="intro">
        We are always wanting, aren’t we? Want pulls us out of sleep. I tell myself I am a conqueror, that the world is mine to take. After all, I am <i>Young! Hungry!</i>
        With so much ahead of me, it drives me mad.<p>

        Once, I told a boy I was hungry. Not for food. He worked at a startup I wanted to be at. He flicked his pencil with his index and thumb, its tip stopping at my elbow.
        Tap. Tap. Tap. Not accidental, no. No? I didn't know. Tap. Tap. Tap. Did he know he was doing it? Did he mean to? 
        He kept talking; polite, his tone easy. But in his eyes, something else: a private joke, a flicker of something that didn't match the conversation.<p>

        A secret language, I thought. Or, an equation: one tap = <i>hello, are you there?</i> Steady like a metronome and, <i>ah!</i> - impossibly deliberate.
        We stood side by side. I couldn’t see his face - only the words we exchanged, so ordinary.
        Had I imagined it? Or, in his precise way, was he was coding a signal I couldn’t yet translate?<p>

        He was no longer just a boy. He was something else - an alternate self, perhaps, from a life where I knew what I was doing and knew where to put myself.
        I met his gaze cautiously, as though testing out the version of me he seemed to see. It fit nicely; though it felt borrowed. And then the question comes: Which was real? The self 
            he saw? Or the one I saw? I think I couldn't fathom the state of not yet, so I divided my fate in two: doomed and not doomed. Maybe, (and get ready, because this is mature!) it is enough to exist
            in the in-between. The relief of it: to be allowed the waiting.</p>
    
        Because, truthfully, I wasn’t who I said I was. No conqueror. I like my coffee iced and sweet. I watch movies where nothing much happens. I sleep deeply and waste my time. 
        I'm indecisive and impatient and I never wait for the kettle to finish boiling. Find me sitting under trees, staring at them like I’ve never seen one before. 
        Maybe that’s laziness. Or ambition too large to bear being a <i>not yet.</i> Or maybe it’s just the excuse I tell myself.<p>

        I had left that night - the boy, the tapping, the look in his eyes. I walked away, but the wanting followed. It always does.
