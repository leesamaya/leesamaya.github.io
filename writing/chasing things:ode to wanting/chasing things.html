    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="intro">
     We are always wanting, aren’t we? Want pulls us out of sleep. I tell myself I am a conqueror, that the world is mine to take. After all, I am <i>Young! Hungry!</i> 
With so much ahead of me, it drives me mad.<p>

Once, I told a boy I was hungry. Not for food. He worked at a startup I wanted to be at. He flicked his pencil with his index and his thumb, tip stopping at my elbow. 
Tap. Tap. Tap. Not accidental, no. No? I don’t know. Tap. Tap. Tap. Did he know he was doing it? Did he mean to? 
He kept talking; polite, tone easy. But in his eyes, something else: a private joke, a flicker of something that wasn't for me to know. The tapping continues.<p>

A secret language, I thought. Or, an equation: one tap = <i>hello, are you there?</i> Steady like a metronome and, ah, impossibly deliberate. 
We stood side by side. I couldn’t see his face — only the words exchanged in conversation, so ordinary. 
Did I imagine it? Or, in his quiet way, was he was coding a signal I couldn’t yet translate?<p>

He was no longer a boy. He was something else - an alternate self, perhaps, from a life where I knew what I was doing and could, if I wanted to, set the world in motion. 
    I met his gaze, cautiously, as though testing on the version of me he seemed to see. And then the question comes: Which was real? The self he conjured, whole and tidy? 
    Or the one I feared I might be? But I know now, it was the wrong question to ask. Perhaps it is enough to remain incomplete, suspended in a state of not yet.
     The relief of it: to be allowed the waiting.</p>
    
Because, truthfully, I wasn’t who I said I was. No conqueror. I like my coffee iced and sweet. I watch movies where nothing much happens. I sleep deeply and waste my time. Find me standing 
under trees, staring at them like I’ve never seen one before. Maybe that’s laziness. Or ambition too large to bear the weight of a <i>not yet.</i> Or maybe it’s just the excuse I tell myself.<p>

I had left him that night - the boy, the tapping, the look in his eyes. I walked away, but the wanting followed. It always does. </div>
