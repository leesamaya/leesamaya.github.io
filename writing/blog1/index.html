<p>I’ve been driving a lot lately - everyday, almost. I try to go to new places everytime, to flex my driving muscles and to also make up for the 21 years I’ve been licenceless. 
    I think of all the wonderful places I will drive myself to - the beach (but far, far away where the water is blue), the Grampians (so I can find a nice rock to climb), 
    Preston Market (for the gozleme and the interesting dips), IKEA (no explanation needed), and a lake. A nice one, with water that glistens in the sun, inside a ring of tall gum trees and rocks. 
    The lake will be small (perhaps a waterhole is the better term) and blue. I’d go with my friend Kath, and we’d have it all to ourselves. The day would unfold in a stretch of time absent from any sense of past or future, 
     where we’d splash around all day long and read our books.</p>

    <p>In the car, I feel most like myself. It’s just me, responding to my own instinct without any outside influence. I have total control over where I go and what I do. I can do my Leesa activities in private and no one can interject.</p>
    <p>When I drive, I wind the window down, always. It has become ritual. When I was learning, I was indifferent to driving. I felt it was boring and mostly useless to my life. Now, the giddiness surprises me. The wind slips through the window and tangles my hair - and the world is so vast, so inviting!
        And yes, she is good - I take back every nasty thing I've ever about her. The air is warm and I think about how lucky I am. I think of all the 21 year old women throughout history who would look at my freedom with envy.</p>
     <p>Sweet Summer, let this feeling last! The novelty of freedom. The absurdity of moving, of going wherever I please. To think of all the adventures ahead of me!</p>
    <p>Today, strawberries: $3 for two. A steal. The gym, a return to my body. The library, long-overdue fashion magazines I borrowed because that's what stylish adult women do. All the little tasks that, together, make a life. 
        I look at all the other cars and feel sorry for them. Don’t they know the joy of rolling down the windows and turning up the music? They are so close to it and yet they choose not to push the button. Why don't they? Have they, too, not yet discovered this simple thrill? Or do they think they don’t deserve it?</p>

 <p>In the car, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7nvD9cQj5wYGY44Mhh3My3" target="_blank"><i>Magnetising</i></a> plays. It's a song like velvet stretched over wire. <i>You seem to be so lonely. You, naughty girl.</i> I am someone else now: a French spy with a cigarette in her mouth, driving a stolen car. I am invincible.</p>
