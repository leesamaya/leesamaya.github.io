            <p>I wind the car windows down, always. It has become a ritual. My dad used to tell me I was a late bloomer: to read, to write, to speak. Two years, he said, was about how long it took me to catch up to my peers. It troubles me now, to think I'm stunted somehow. But when I reflect on it, he's not so wrong. I got my first real zit was when I was 18. My thighs arrived at 19, and I realized I was, in fact, capable of sexual attraction at 20. Now, at 21, I can drive a car. It's embarrasing how long I put it off - plain laziness, if I'm honest. But now, the giddiness surprises me. The wind slips through the open windows and tangles my hair. The world spreads out, vast and inviting. Sweet Summer, let this feeling last. The novelty of freedom. To think of all the adventures ahead of me!</p>

            <p>Today, strawberries: $3 for two. A steal. The gym, a return to my body. The library, long-overdue fashion magazines I borrowed because that's what stylish adult women do. All the little tasks that, together, make a life. I look at all the other cars and feel sorry for them. Don’t they know the joy of rolling down the windows and turning up the music? They are so close to it and yet they choose not to push the button. Why don't they? Do they think they don’t deserve it?</p>

 <p>In the car, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7nvD9cQj5wYGY44Mhh3My3" target="_blank"><i>Magnetising</i></a> plays. It's a song like velvet stretched over wire. <i>You seem to be so lonely. You, naughty girl.</i> I am someone else now: a French spy with a cigarette in her mouth, driving a stolen car. I am invincible.</p>
