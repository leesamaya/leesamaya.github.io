        <p>My Profile/p>
        <p>sensitiity</p>
        <p>Wise and Quiet<p>
        <p>Modesty.</p>
        <p>True Love</p>
        <p>Great Intellectual Power</p>
        <p>Shyness</p>
        <p>Wrong, so wrong, but not sure about what exactly</p>
        <p>Deeply pensive at times</p>
        <p>Mistrustful, remote from the world of men, but close to nature, the sun, the moon, close to the night, to dreams</p>
        <p>Childish, vain, self-seeking, defiant, in need of love, unjust, sensitive, lazy, irresponsible</p>
        <p>Possesed by an insatiable curiosity</p>
        <p>Plunged into the world of the mysterious.</p>
        <p>The Black Monk by Anton Chekov, was he genius, or mad, or both? Am I genius, or mad, or both?</p>
        <p>A delight in solitude. Nature is full of wonders, every plant, every stone seems alive to me. They are forever while I am temporary, they do not judge me for crying, for being still, for saying nothing, for being boring. They do not care for my feelings but they are there and they are conscious so I'm not very alone.</p>
        <p>Leesa, where have you been? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, No, I really am sorry, it's not acceptable and I do not expect the rules to bend for me. You see, um, I don't feel real, I do not feel right, there is something very wrong and I don't know how to fix it. I'm really sorry, I really am, I don't think I'm up to par to being human, it might have been better if I were born a rock, I don
        t know what to do.</p>
        <p>I think God is real but He does not care for morals or goodness, He is just is, you know? That silent force that leaves you feeling small, terrified and slightly awe-struck</p>
        <p>Away from the whole human world although I love humans I like them a lot, I like to think about them and write about them and dream about them</p>
        <p>I posses repulsive traits that I am mostly unaware of</p>
        <p>A 2nd personality that is strictly private</p>
        <p>A talent for hoola hooping forever, there is no end, and making carrot cake</p>
        <p>What is that? A flicker of beauty - yes, I saw that - it flickers when they feel caught. A flash of uh oh. A flicker of shit, you saw me. I caught that. I caught you I will now keep that milisecond of You and store it in my hippocampus to revisit when I need to amuse myself </p>
        <p>Every now and then I suddenly understand I am worthy of myself. I feel old and I am certain of my authority. It is an eery calmness and suddenly I do not need anything, I have everything I need, I do not yearn, I do not wish to prove my existence, I exist, I am outside of time, I belong to the centuries.</p>
        <p>Come back! Where did she go?</p>
        <p>Live below your means. Accept that life isn't fair. Let someone cut ahead of you in traffic and don't complain. Life doesn't owe you anything. Control what you can control.</p>
        <p>Know when to shut the fuck up</p>
        <p>Pay attention! Beauty is all around you.</p>
