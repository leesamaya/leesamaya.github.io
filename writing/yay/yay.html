        <p>profile</p>
        <p>Sensitiity</p>
        <p>Wise and Quiet<p>
        <p>Modesty.</p>
        <p>True Love</p>
        <p>Great Intellectual Power</p>
        <p>Shyness</p>
        <p>Wrong, But Not Sure About What Exactly</p>
        <p>Deeply Pensive At Times</p>
        <p>Mistrustful, remote from the world of men, but close to nature, the sun, the moon, close to the night, to dreams</p>
        <p>Childish, vain, self-seeking, defiant, in need of love, unjust, sensitive, lazy, irresponsible</p>
        <p>Possesed by an insatiable curiosity</p>
        <p>Autumn Sweater by Yo La Tengo</p>
        <p>Plunged into the world of the mysterious.</p>
        <p>20.5.22 He was so strikingly innocent in the most unusual way; my brain couldn't seem to compute the entirity of his being.</p>
        <p>A child-like perception of time. This is managable, and can be aided with external signals of time passing such as alarms.</p>
        <p>The Black Monk by Anton Chekov: was Kovrin a genius, or mad, or both?</p>
        <p>A delight in solitude. Nature is full of wonders, every plant, every stone seems alive to me. They are forever, while I am temporary. They do not judge me for crying, for being still, for saying nothing, for being boring. They do not care for my feelings but they are there and they are conscious so I'm not very alone.</p>
        <p>Leesa, where have you been? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I really am - it's unacceptable and I do not expect the rules to bend for me. I have no excuse, but you see, sometimes I don't feel right, I feel wrong and I don't know how to fix it. I'm really sorry, I really am, it may have been better if I were born a rock, I don't know what to do.</p>
        <p>“There is sometimes, in discourse around gender, the assumption that women are supposedly ‘better’ than men. They are not. Women are just as human as men are. Female goodness is just as normal as female evil.”- Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Dear Ijeawele: A Feminist Manifesto</p>
        <p>God is real but I suspect He doesn't care for morals or goodness. He is just is, you know, that overwhelming presence that leaves you feeling tiny and slightly awe-struck</p>
        <p>Away from the whole human world although I like humans, I like them a lot, I like to think about them and write about them and dream about them</p>
        <p>I posses repulsive traits that I am mostly unaware of.</p>
        <p>My mom and dad love me ;)</p>
        <p>A 2nd personality that is strictly private.</p>
        <p>什么?</p>
        <p>A talent for hoola hooping forever, there is no end, and making carrot cake</p>
        <p>What was that? No, that. I saw that - a flicker of beauty - yes, you - it flickers when you feel caught. A flash of uh oh. A flicker of shit, you saw me. I caught that, I caught you, and I will now keep that milisecond of You and store it in my hippocampus to revisit whenever I need to amuse myself </p>
        <p>Every now and then I suddenly understand I am worthy of myself. I feel old and I am certain of my authority. It is an eery calmness and suddenly I do not need anything, I have everything I need, I do not yearn, I do not wish to justify my existence, I exist, I am outside of time, I belong to the centuries.</p>
        <p>Come back! Where did she go?</p>
        <p>Live below your means. Realize and accept that life isn't fair. Let someone cut ahead of you in traffic and don't complain. Know when to shut the fuck up. Life doesn't owe you anything. Control what you can control. Invest early. You do not need a reason to save. Don't ever touch a cigarette.</p>
        <p>Pay attention! Beauty is all around you.</p>
