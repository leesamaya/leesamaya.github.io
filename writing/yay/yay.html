        <p>Sensitiity</p>
        <p>Wise and Quiet<p>
        <p>Modesty</p>
        <p>True Love</p>
        <p>Great Intellectual Power</p>
        <p>Shyness</p>
        <p>Wrong, But Not Sure About What Exactly</p>
        <p>Deeply Pensive At Times</p>
        <p>Mistrustful, remote from the world of men, but close to nature, the sun, the moon, close to the night, to dreams</p>
        <p>Childish, vain, self-seeking, defiant, in need of love, unjust, sensitive, lazy, irresponsible.</p>
        <p>Possesed by an insatiable curiosity</p>
        <p>Autumn Sweater - Yo La Tengo: <i>It's a waste of time, if I can't smile easily. Like in the beginning...</i></p>
        <p>Plunged into the world of the mysterious.</p>
        <p>20.5.21 <i>He is so strikingly innocent in the most unusual way; my brain can't seem to compute the entirity of his being. Boyish, I think that's the word. A masculinity so pure it is unguarded, confident in its own sheepishness. </i></p>
        <p>A child-like perception of time. This is managable, and can be aided with external signals of time passing such as alarms.</p>
        <p><i>The Black Monk</i> by Anton Chekov: was Kovrin a genius, or mad, or both? Is delusion acceptable if it gave his life meaning?</p>
        <p>A delight in solitude. Nature is full of wonders; every plant, every stone seems alive to me. They are eternal, and I am temporary. They do not judge me - for crying, for being still, for saying nothing, for being boring. They do not care for my feelings but they are there, and they are conscious. So I'm not truly alone.</p>
        <p>Leesa, where have you been? I'm sorry, I really am - it's unacceptable and I don't expect the rules to bend for me. You see, uh, sometimes I don't feel right, I feel wrong and I don't know how to fix it. I'm really am sorry, it may have been better if I were born a rock, I don't know what to do.</p>
        <p>Thug it out, Leesa.</p>
        <p><i>“There is sometimes, in discourse around gender, the assumption that women are supposedly ‘better’ than men. They are not. Women are just as human as men are. Female goodness is just as normal as female evil.”</i>     - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Dear Ijeawele: A Feminist Manifesto</p>
        <p>Yeah Chimamanda, I am kind of evil. You see, I have discovered a twisted sort of glee in exploiting my - well, Girl Power, if you will. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I stare at a boy until he crumbles. His ego structures collapse. He knows I see through him, and I watch him try to recover. I am a cruel girl.</p>
        <p>Away from the whole human world although I like humans, I like them a lot actually, I like to think about them and write about them and dream about them!</p>
        <p>I posses repulsive traits that I am mostly unaware of.</p>
        <p>My mom and dad love me ;)</p>
        <p>God is real but I suspect He doesn't care much for morals or goodness. He is just is. You know, that overwhelming presence that leaves you feeling tiny and slightly awe-struck. (I will revisit and review this belief system in one week's time.)</p>
        <p>A 2.0 personality that is strictly private.</p>
        <p>什么?</p>
        <p>A talent for hoola hooping forever, there is no end, and making carrot cake.</p>
        <p>What was that? No, that. I saw that - a flicker of beauty - yes, you. It flickers when you feel caught. A flash of <i>uh oh.</i> A flicker of <i>shit, you saw me.</i> I caught that, and I caught you; I will now keep that milisecond of You and store it in my hippocampus to revisit whenever I need to amuse myself. Also, you're beautiful. </p>
        <p>Every now and then, I become fully conscious that I am worthy of myself. I'll be stepping out of a shop or sitting on a tram, and I suddenly I am old, entirely certain of my authority. It is an eerie calmness - and I do not need anything; everything I need is already inside of me. I do not yearn. I feel no urge to justify my existence to the outside world. I exist, and I am outside of time. I belong to the centuries.</p>
        <p>Fuck man, come back! Where did she go?</p>
        <p>Live below your means. Realize and accept that life isn't fair. Let someone cut ahead of you in a line. Be kind to people, all kinds of people. Strive for excellence. Be on time. Life doesn't owe you anything. Control what you can control. Don't think about yourself too much, you're as shallow as a petri dish. Know when to shut the fuck up. No one is above you or below you. Invest early. Don't ever touch a cigarette.</p>
        <p>Pay attention! Beauty is all around you.
