    <div class="intro">
        <p><p>Edie does not wish to be understood. She does not optimise her mornings or scale anything. She climbs trees. She owns one dress. When asked for an interview, she said yes, though she warned she had nothing important to say.<br><br>What follows is a transcript of a conversation that goes nowhere in particular. It covers beauty, solitude, mild delusion, and the soft art of being a person.<br><br>There are no takeaways. Just pay attention. Some girls don’t explain themselves. That doesn’t mean they’re not serious.</p>
</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>On Beauty</strong></p>
    <p><em>L:</em> What’s your life ethos?<br><em>E:</em> Strive for perfection but be satisfied with beauty.</p>
    <p><em>L:</em> Why beauty?<br><em>E:</em> Because my favourite activities are having beautiful conversations with people, hanging out with people who have beautiful minds, and looking at beautiful things. That’s the best the world has to offer.</p>
    <p><em>L:</em> What makes things beautiful to you?<br><em>E:</em> Something’s beautiful if it’s something my mind can't compute. If I look at something and can’t picture it in my head—like it’s a new thing the world’s showing me.</p>

</div>


    <p><strong>On Spiritual Ambition</strong></p>
    <p><em>L:</em> Who do you admire?<br><em>E:</em> I used to admire people, but everyone has flaws. Everyone's a real person. Maybe my future self inspires me.</p>
    <p><em>L:</em> What’s she like?<br><em>E:</em> Calm. I get annoyed easily, so I’m trying to be more chill. And I am chill. Everyone says I'm the chillest person they know, but I want to be incredibly chill.<br><em>L:</em> You’re levelling up your chill.<br><em>E:</em> Exactly.</p>

<h2>I read this book once where a girl says to a boy she’s been watching from afar, “Choose your words carefully. What do you want your first words to me to be?” And he says, “I love you.” As his first words. I want that to happen to me.</h2>

    <p><strong>On Being Herself</strong></p>
    <p><em>E:</em> I’m really perceptive to what people want, and I often morph myself into the ideal person in any situation. I’ve spent my whole life trying to make sure everyone’s at ease. Like, hanging out with someone and feeling like I'm not even being myself.</p>
    <p><em>L:</em> What you think they want you to be.<br><em>E:</em> Yeah. And willingly giving up embarrassing information just so they feel comfortable. I'm trying to be a bit more selfish, I guess.</p>

    <p><em>L:</em> I think that’s really common. Especially for women. We’re taught our value comes from being liked.<br><em>E:</em> Yeah. As a woman, you're kind of conditioned to feel like you're not meant to be there. But men walk into a room and they’re comfortable by default.</p>

</div>


    <p><strong>On Style</strong></p>
    <p><em>L:</em> What’s your philosophy on style?<br><em>E:</em> I live a simple life, and I present that way too. I don’t wear jewellery. Usually just a dress and shoes. I know what I like and I stick to it. I like to think I’m sure of myself and unapologetic about that.</p>
    <p>I believe part of happiness is returning to your childhood—if you had a nice one. I’ve been getting into climbing trees and stuff. I guess I’m tapping into my 2009 self. That simplicity. Not saying I’m a simple girl. No, no, no.</p>

    <p><em>L:</em> That’s what makes your style feel so real. You’re not trying to be anything. You believe in it.<br><em>E:</em> Wow.<br><em>L:</em> The best style matches the way someone lives and thinks.<br><em>E:</em> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

    <p><em>L:</em> Like Steve Jobs and his turtleneck. People say he’s stylish because it was Issey Miyake, but really it was stylish it was just a decision he made to make his life easier. It was a byproduct of his life. It could've been anything.<br><em>E:</em> Yeah, and it would still be cool.</p>

    <p> Steve Jobs is so sexy. I was in New Zealand once, went on a road trip with no belongings, just one dress the whole time. It was freeing. I felt like Steve Jobs.<br><em>L:</em> Why?<br><em>E:</em> I felt like Eve. I know she doesn't have clothes, but I was just a woman with one dress.<br><em>L:</em> Yeah.<br><em>E:</em> I am my dress.</p>

    <p><strong>On Happiness</strong></p>
    <p><em>L:</em> What does the world misunderstand?em>E:</em> Probably where happiness comes from. Thinking it comes from ticking off all the goals you think you’re meant to tick off. I don’t know for sure, but I think lots of people chase that thinking it’ll make them happy. And they’re not.</p>

    <p><strong>On Marriage and First Dates</strong></p>
    <p><em>E:</em> I want to get married on a first date.<br><em>L:</em> On a first date?<br><em>E:</em> Yeah. I always say this on dates, and no one wants to marry me.</p>
    <p><em>L:</em> I'm sorry to hear that, Edie.<br><em>E:</em> I read this book once where a girl says to a boy she’s been watching from afar, “Choose your words carefully. What do you want your first words to me to be?” And he says, “I love you.” As his first words. I want that to happen to me.</p>

<p><strong>On Loneliness and Mundanity</strong></p>


<p><em>L:</em> What are you naturally good at?<br>
<em>E:</em> Reading people. Not between the lines—above the lines. I see misunderstandings around me and I just know where things went wrong. I don’t want to step in or act like I’m smarter, because it’s not about intelligence. I think I have an innate understanding of human behaviour. When people do something annoying, I can usually see the deeper reason behind it. A need for comfort, love, validation—whatever it is. I can spot it.</p>

<p><em>L:</em> Do you think anyone could fully know you?<br>
<em>E:</em> No. I think loneliness is just part of the human condition. I call it solitude. It’s not necessarily bad. I often feel lonelier around groups of people. I prefer being with one or two people. Or being alone. Like, I really love just hanging out in my room.</p>

<p><em>L:</em> Stop.<br>
<em>E:</em> Just doing my thing. I like to clean my room. There’s always something to put away.</p>

<p><em>L:</em> Do you put music on when you do that?<br>
<em>E:</em> Yeah. I love the act of trying to enjoy something mundane. I live a pretty mundane life and I like it. I think people don't appreciate that, no? The world pays too much attention to big, flashy things. I like to notice funny little full circle moments, or like, a little thing. So often I’d walk on my usual path and stare at a random brick, and then I’ll decide to make a conscious effort to always look at it when I walk past.</p>

<p><em>L:</em> You can entertain yourself.<br>
<em>E:</em> Exactly. There’s lots of fun little things to do in the world.</p>

<p><em>L:</em> The Edie Mind is rich.<br>
<em>E:</em> It is.</p>
