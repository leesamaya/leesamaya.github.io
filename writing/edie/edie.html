    <h1>Edie Speaks (briefly)</h1>

    <div class="intro">
        <p>You have identified a boy. He is ordinary, 
            yet to you, he gleams. You hesitate, suspended in the pull
            of wanting and waiting.
            There are methods for this. They are straightforward 
            and absurdly practical.</p>
    </div>

</div>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Locate Him</strong><br>
       The boy exists somewhere near. Fix your gaze on him. He may not know yet he is the object of such focus.</li>

        <li><strong>Observe</strong><br>
       He moves, as boys do, without knowing he is seen. You look, and then you are caught. Do not flinch.
            Resist the instinct to turn away. The world, in that moment, may shift ever so slightly in your favour.</li>

        <li><strong>Accept The Odds</strong><br>
        Know that most will not reciprocate. The gaze is rare and its meanings rarer still. It is not a failing. Do not linger over this.</li>

        <li><strong>Approach</strong><br>
            Walk up to him. Stand as if you belong where you are. Speak plainly:<br>

        <i>Hello. My name is ______. Iâ€™m going to skip rocks by the river tonight. Do you want to come?</i><br>

Say no more. You have placed the weight of decision onto his side.

              <li><strong>Wait, But Not For Him</strong><br>
        </p>If he agrees, let it happen as it will. If he declines, go to the river anyway. The rocks wait. The river is yours. You are no less for trying.

The world does not care for longing, but it sometimes bends to those who move through it as if it were bendable. That you dared is enough.<p>
            
    </ol>
