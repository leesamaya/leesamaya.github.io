    <p>Today is Liana’s birthday. Let me tell you a bit about this girl I know.</p>
    <p>Liana is one of the strangest people I’ve ever met. She is born with a delicately sharp beauty that exudes out of her in the way she rolls her eyes, rolls her cig, rolls her head laughing at something. But do her elegant features match her demeanour? Not quite. You see, she's kind of… trashy.</p>
    <p>According to Google, trashy (adj) is defined as something “of poor quality.” Now, don’t twist my words: we are not talking about the girl. We are talking about the girl’s fondness for the trashy; the ugly, the unwanted. Men’s skinny jeans from Savers. Accessories that look like it could be a biohazard. Politically incorrect British reality TV. Addison Rae’s music. Lonely men breaching 40. Ballet flats with a hole that exposes her big toe (only when lifted up). How she manages to look like Kate Moss and not a homeless individual should be studied - and I must admit, I’m envious.</p>
    <p>She lives her life slightly repulsed by all things shiny and beautiful (hence her refusal to move on from her iPhone 6). But this aversion goes beyond possessions. Celebrities. Visiting the Eiffel Tower. Her strong discomfort for Instagram. Liana has a low fakeness tolerance. How will she function in our modern society?</p>
    <p>But she seems to be, and well. Ironically enough, her job is the epitome of vanity: modelling. It is a form of investigative journalism, she insists, to go to Milan and observe the hungry, miserable girls who play the game, and write down everything they say in a notebook so she can turn it into a film when she’s 48.</p>
    <p>Her life dreams don’t fit into modern society’s likings of glamour either. She has two that I know of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>to drive off alone into the red horizon of the Australian desert (a reoccurring scene that doesn’t go away), and</li>
        <li>to spend 2 years in a small, Trump-supporting town in the middle of nowhere America and have beers with cowboys. The goal? Ask Liana for this one.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Happy birthday Liana. I think you’re quite a character, and an even better friend.</p>
